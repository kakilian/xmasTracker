# xmasTracker
Personal made Wishlist. For Special Events especially for Christmas. 

## Function

This APP can, 
 - Track Multiple Peoples Wishlists: As a person who buys gifts for multiple family members or friends, I want to create seperate wishlists for each person, so that I can easily keep their gift wishes organzied.
 - Add Wishes Over Time: As a user who hears gift ideas throughout the year, I want to quickly add new wishes whenever I remember or someone mentions something, so that I dont forget these ideas by Christmas.
 - Edit & Maintain Lists: As a user who updates gift plans I want to edit, reorder, or delete wishlist items, so that each persons list stays accurate and up to date.
 - View All Wishlists at a Glance: As a user preparing for Christmas, I want to browse all my saved wishlists easily, so that I can decide what to buy.
 - Mark Items as Purchased: As a user, I want to mark wishlist items as “purchased”, so that I can track my progress.
